# Efficient Streaming Pipelines at Scale with Databricks and Dash

Source code for December Webinar with Databricks. Requires Dash Enterprise packages (Dashboard Engine and Snapshots) to be runnable. Connects to a Databricks backend that can be set up using the notebooks in [this repo](https://github.com/CodyAustinDavis/edw-best-practices/tree/main/Realtime%20Data%20Apps%20Workshop). 

This app is deployed live at https://sales-demo.plotly.com/dbx-dash-webinar

NOTE: The stream from Databricks will only output updated data for approximately a day. It is likely that the app will not be showing updated data.
